>CTW was the first project I used Robotlegs on. Even though we didn’t use it extensively—the other developer on the project was not familiar with dependency injection—it provided a nice solid architecture to jump off of. And due to its minimal nature, even when we weren’t leveraging it, it was never in the way.
